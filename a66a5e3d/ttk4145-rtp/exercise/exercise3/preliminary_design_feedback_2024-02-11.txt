"If every request has been backuped? Which problems remains to be solved?"

No, you are right. You have understood the problem and you describe
a solution. No more problems. As such. Just to make it work :-) Great
work; go for it.

A primary backup systems has some quite rigid demands; You /need/ to
know who is the master, who is the backup, which elevators are in the
system, that the backup has the same world view as the master etc.

It is viable to build this on top of UDP or UDP broadcast,
certainly. And what you write seems OK. Though I do not feel entirely
safe that you have thought of everything.. But your direction is very good.

The largest worry I have for you is that you are making a more
complicated solution than necessary... "More backups than physical
elevators" because "it is good for redundancy" scares me. Please be
careful.
-> valid resoning would be: easier to program
